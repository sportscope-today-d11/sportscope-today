    "content":"Sergio Conceicao is said to be among Barca\u2019s main candidates to replace Xavi in the summer. Deco is personally interested in inviting the Portuguese to the club: the 49-year-old is set to leave Porto at the end of the season and Blaugrana\u2019s sporting director knows him well.The former Portugal international has done a decent job at the helm of Porto. Let\u2019s see what he can offer us.***Conceicao is renowned for his teams\u2019 intense, high-tempo, aggressive style of play. His players aim to regain possession quickly and go forward using all their width in a 4-4-2 formation that turns into 4-2-4 in the offensive phase. In defence, he mostly relies on players in the middle of the park, using two energetic midfielders (one of those is ex-La Masia prospect Nico) and two rock-solid centre-backs.Porto\u2019s biggest strength under Conceicao is exactly the way they attack down the wings: full-backs actively support wingers who cut inside while one of the two strikers drops back. You may spot multiple wingers and full-backs among Porto\u2019s players with the most goal contributions this season.In recent head-to-head clashes, Barca players struggled to properly mark Porto\u2019s opposition attackers, allowing multiple big chances despite dominating the game in possession.Expectedly, Porto\u2019s biggest weakness is defending the wings: Conceicao\u2019s first-choice wing-backs, Wendell and Joao Mario, are usually pretty much involved in the attack and it\u2019s difficult to cover for them all the time. The Portuguese specialist probably dreams of working with Joao Cancelo who is arguably the most complete wing-back one may find.Let\u2019s think about two line-ups Conceicao might use at Barcelona:Lineup 1Ter Stegen; Cancelo, Araujo, Kounde, Balde; Yamal, De Jong, Gavi, Raphinha; Lewandowski, Felix.Looks like a great option if Barca make no big summer signings. Two attack-minded wing-backs, the centre-back partnership that looked fantastic against Porto in the Champions League, dynamic and energetic midfield and the four-man attack full of players Conceicao would love to work with (he actually coached Raphinha for some time back in the day).Lineup 2Ter Stegen; Cancelo, Araujo, Kounde, Balde; Raphinha, Gavi, Pedri, Pep\u00ea; Lewandowski, Felix.If there\u2019s one player Conceicao would probably want to take to Barca, it\u2019s Pep\u00ea (not the Real Madrid bully), especially given Blaugrana\u2019s plan to sign a left winger. The 26-year-old leads the way with the most assists for Porto this season \u2013\u00a0just like last term when he finished the campaign with 10.Is Sergio Conceicao your preferred candidate to take over at Barca?

    "content":"Man United reportedly consider Bayern Munich midfielder Joshua Kimmich as a potential summer target as he fits their criteria of a player whose contract expires next year.The Red Devils have decided to go after players with contracts expiring soon and are interested in bringing a versatile, energetic player like Kimmich to the team.Bayern Munich might be forced to sell the German midfielder if unable to convince him to sign a long-term contract, with his current deal expiring at the end of June, 2025.Kimmich would be the quality midfielder signing that Erik ten Hag reportedly wants for the summer. With his set-piece quality, ball retention ability and passing traits, he can definitely help the Red Devils control games better. With that being said, here are two ways Man United can line up with him next season.Option 1: In midfield with MainooKimmich can slot into Man United\u2019s midfield shape nicely and also be the ideal partner for the blossoming Kobbie Mainoo. As he likes to play a more deeper role, the German midfielder can allow Mainoo to wander forward in attempts to create moves and score goals. Joshua and Mainoo\u2019s energy and defensive qualities mean that Bruno Fernandes can also probably play a more attacking role going forward.Option 2: Emergancy right-back optionEven though he\u2019s now a full-fledged midfielder, Kimmich is a really versatile player who has played as a right-back in the past for Bayern Munich. That means he can be a cover option in that area too for Man United, potentially allowing the club to play the Casemiro-Mainoo connection. Kimmich boasts a decent crossing ability, so he can overlap from the right and create chances with his delivery too.",

It all started after the youngster racked up 75 games in a single season, including representing Spain at the Euros and Tokyo Olympics during the 2020\/21 campaign, which was clearly too much for an 18-year-old to handle and took its toll on the player.Now, according to Diario Sport, the Spanish under-23 coach Santi Denia wants the youngster at the upcoming Olympic Games in Paris that are scheduled for the end of July, just ten days after the Euros.While Barcelona wouldn't be able to block the call-up without facing sanctions, the player has the autonomy to make that decision himself. What happens if he refuses?In the worst-case scenario, Denia might opt not to call him up again in the future, but it won't hurt Pedri much since the midfielder's already part of the senior squad anyway.'For the club and for you': Pedri's strong message to Culers amid Xavi's season-end departure",

The Uruguayan reportedly will consider leaving Barca if there is 'no evolution' within the current squad.

Given a potential arrival of Aleix Garcia and the planned purchase of a high-profile defensive midfielder, Barca are going to have too many midfielders in their roster.

If the Pole doesn't improve considerably until the end of the season, Barca may decide to offload him to Saudi Arabia earlier than initially planned.Jules Kounde. The centre-back's form has dropped significantly since his latest injury. His current deal with Blaugrana expires in 2027, he still has some immense potential, so there could be lots of clubs interested.Ansu Fati.

While he lacks impact up front, his numbers are still decent as he magnets plenty of goal contributions.Ferran Torres. The Spaniard's impressive goalscoring form should boost his price tag and the chance of a summer exit.Andreas Christensen. The Dane is having a much worse season than the previous one. With his contract expiring in 2026, Barca could generate a solid fee from his sale.Inaki Pena. Barca's second-choice goalkeeper is not part of the future project, according to the latest reports.

Well, according to The Athletic, it's not too soon to presume Guardiola's heading in that direction. Klopp has announced he will leave Liverpool at the end of this season. Considering his influence for the Merseysiders, who are on course to win another Premier League title, fans won't be too sad to see him go. Another nemesis for Man United is, of course, Guardiola, who has single-handedly set exceptionally high standards for the Premier League. Fortunately, The Athletic understands Pep is unlikely to stick around and may look to return to Barcelona once his contract expires at the end of next season. Guardiola was being linked with a departure even in 2022\/23, which ended with Man City winning the treble.

If Mbappe leaves PSG in June he will do so as a free agent with Real Madrid not obligated to pay any transfer fee. Still, the sign-on bonus will be the biggest ever paid for a player arriving on a free transfer in football history if Florentino Perez agrees to it. Mbappe's salary demands are also acrimonious when compared to what other Real Madrid players currently earn. Madrid's top earner Toni Kroos bags less than \u20ac15m net per season.

The Blaugrana earned around \u20ac3m for lifting the trophy that year, including TV revenue. Fast forward to 2024, Messi is long gone and Barca can't get past the quarter-final stage of the Copa Del Rey. This season, the winners of the Copa del Rey will smile to the bank with a fixed prize money of \u20ac1.2m. When TV revenue is factored in, the champions could go home with around \u20ac5 million in winnings. Usually, the Copa del Rey prize money depends on the competition's TV revenue for the year. Although it's nowhere near La Liga, winning the competition comes with a handsome financial reward exceeding \u20ac5 million for top clubs like Barca who attract larger TV audiences. The Blaugrana could do with every penny. Barca earned around \u20ac400,000 for reaching the quarter-final of the Copa Del Rey this year, but that's barely enough to cover Frenkie De Jong's two weeks salary. Besides the prize money from the Copa Del Rey, Barca are also at risk of missing out of the Spanish Super Cup next January. Appearing in the competition this year fetched Barca \u20ac6 million in revenue. Barca's route to the Super Cup now lies in winning La Liga or at least finishing second like they did two seasons ago.

The post, with 87,000 likes and 108,000 followers, had the caption, \"The Ballon d'Or hits different when it's earned.\" This follows Ronaldo's questioning the credibility of individual awards, especially after Lionel Messi's recent win for Best FIFA Men's player.\"I think that, in a way, these awards are losing credibility.

On both occasions, Martin Odegaard was spotted doing something with his socks. That's according to BBC Match of the Day pundit, former Wales and Swansea defender Ashley Williams. Williams noted Odegaard tampering with his socks before both corners as a possible signal to the taker on where to hit the corner. Quoted by Give Me Sport, Williams said: \"There\u2019s always a trigger for what the [corner's] movement\u2019s going to be, and we can see they have worked on whether it\u2019s a front-post corner or a back-post corner.\"If you keep an eye on Odegaard, we feel - maybe we\u2019ve had too much time on our hands - but we feel that maybe he\u2019s signalling something to the corner taker.\"He\u2019s in the same place for every corner and he\u2019s playing with his socks.

With surgery scheduled for next week, it's unlikely Joelinton will feature again this season.Reports suggest that Joelinton's current wage demands exceed what Newcastle are willing to pay, leading to speculation that he might be sold before making another appearance. The Mail outlines that, with only 18 months left on his current deal, a compromise needs to be reached for Joelinton's long-term future at the club.It would be tough for Howe to lose the midfielder, as he really wants to keep Joelinton. However, it might be challenging since Joelinton's requests would make him the highest-paid player at the club.Newcastle open to selling to one of their best players 'liked by Deco'",

    "content":"Napoleon Bonaparte was one of the greatest conquerors in history. A detailed mathematical analysis proves he is actually the greatest general in history of warfare, beating the second-highest performer, Julius Caesar, by a huge margin \u2013\u00a016.679 WAR (Wins Above Replacement\u00a0\u2013 an estimate of a general's performance in war compared to other top generals) against 7.445.The unique set of skills he possessed at the time could\u2019ve also made him the GOAT among modern football managers. As a smart and innovative tactician, the French leader didn\u2019t mind replacing seasoned generals with younger ones to keep his strategies fresh. Despite surviving on a mere 3-4 hours of sleep per day, he relentlessly improved his abilities through hard work. Beyond his military prowess, Napoleon's greatness lay in his profound connection with simple soldiers as he earned their genuine affection through his exceptional man-management skills.Who would make Napoleon's roster?Mostly loyal, hardworking players who are also pacy, mobile and creative enough.Mike Maignan. Faithful, consistent \u2013 the Milan goalkeeper would be France\u2019s first choice no matter who the head coach is. We may compare him to Napoleon\u2019s cavalry officer Joachim Murat, a key figure in Bonaparte\u2019s inner circle whose leadership was crucial in multiple battles, especially in the Jena-Austerstedt one against the Prussian forces.Jules Kounde. His mobility is truly impressive. Like marshal Louis-Gabriel Suchet, Kounde has mostly succeeded on Spanish battlefields. Moreover, Suchet\u2019s most notable campaign occurred in Catalonia where he displayed exceptional defensive and organisational skills.William Saliba. The centre-back is a real fighter who knows how to clean up his teammates\u2019 mistakes in the rear. As the standout defender, he could be compared to general Auguste de Marmont who demonstrated outstanding defensive skills during the Peninsular War and in various battles against the British.Dayot Upamecano. The Bayern centre-back is one of the most powerful and hardworking players in the roster. His aggressiveness reminds us of another of Napoleon\u2019s marshals, Pierre Augereau, who led the French forces in a fierce way against the Austrian army at the Battle of Castiglione.Theo Hernandez. The left-back would have a special role on Napoleon\u2019s team as the most damaging attacks would be launched exactly from his wing. His fearlessness and audacity would make him as important as marshal Jean Lannes was for Bonaparte \u2013\u00a0his bold and effective attacks helped turn things around in the Battle of Marengo against the Austrians.Eduardo Camavinga. The midfielder has made his fans create songs about him \u2013\u00a0almost as if he were some legendary soldier of the past. Cama is a versatile warrior who can occupy almost every position in midfield in defence. Eduardo\u2019s historical \u2018twin\u2019 is Nicolas Soult who rapidly rose through the ranks at a young age and demonstrated top ability in both defence and offence.Aurelien Tchouameni. The defensive midfielder will make sure Bonaparte\u2019s winning record is perfect \u2013\u00a0Real Madrid are yet to lose a single game with him on the pitch this season. We would compare him to Andre Massena, one of Napoleon\u2019s most successful comrades, also called the \u2018Dear Child of Victory\u2019.Kingsley Coman. It\u2019s not just the pace that makes Coman special \u2013\u00a0he is also clutch in big games, including Champions League finals. Besides, few players can boast about having won 29 trophies at just 27 years old. His historical prototype can be Louis-Alexandre Berthier who broke into the French army as a youngster and played a big role in campaigns all over the world.Antoine Griezmann. One of the most loyal players in the history of the national team. A symbol of Les Bleus who has hit his prime again. Griezmann is the analogue of Napoleon\u2019s \u2018Iron Marshal\u2019 Louis-Nicolas Davout, mostly known for his tactical brilliance and exceptional intelligence that was at its best at the Battle of Austerlitz.Kylian Mbappe. Although the French superstar is not an easy player to deal with, he remains the team\u2019s most powerful force for years to come. His effectiveness and courage make us feel he is Michel Ney \u2013 Napoleon\u2019s legendary comrade who led his army from the front lines, particularly in the Peninsular War against the Spanish and Portuguese where he earned the \u2018Bravest of the Brave\u2019 nickname.Olivier Giroud. The 36-year-old is definitely not among the fastest France players, but his work rate and physical ability make him a standout performer too. As a recent Serie A winner who keeps playing a key role at 37, he could be compared to Eugene de Beauharnais, the Viceroy of Italy who was quite effective in some of the biggest engagements of the Napoleonic Wars including the Battle of Wagram.What formation would he choose?To identify Napoleon\u2019s game plan, let\u2019s use the famous Battle of Austerlitz as an example \u2013 the engagement that took place between the French army and the Russian and Austrian forces in 1805, ending in the latter\u2019s decisive defeat and the collapse of the Third Coalition which was chiefly made up of Britain, Austria and Russia.It\u2019s arguably as iconic as the 1998 World Cup final between France and Brazil. Just like in that game, where France played with 10 men for half an hour, Bonaparte\u2019s troops were outnumbered \u2013\u00a0some 72,000 men against 85,000 opposition soldiers.Here is a brief description of what was happening on the battlefield back then:Based on Napoleon\u2019s deployment of troops during the Austerlitz, we believe he would pick the 4-2-1-3 formation for his team. It would be quite asymmetric, though, as his greatest tactical trick would be deceiving the opposition by deliberately weakening the right side, just like in the famous battle:With the opposition mostly deploying their forces on France\u2019s right flank, Napoleon would take advantage of the gap in the opponent\u2019s middle area and attack the space:After the midfield battle is won and the opposition are spread to the left and the right, Napoleon would proceed by attacking the opponent\u2019s vulnerable wings \u2013 mostly through his left which is still fresh as it wasn\u2019t quite involved yet.Although Kylian Mbappe is usually used as a striker in the national team, here he would be deployed on the left wing to use his pace to the fullest. Call it one more major tactical tweak of Bonaparte to make his left wing absolutely destructive:After the opposition is exhausted, Napoleon would make sure the battle is won by using his reserves. Explosive forwards like Randal Kolo Muani, Moussa Diaby and Christopher Nkunku could add some freshness to the attack in the second half:Napoleon Bonaparte would\u2019ve really taken the world of football by storm \u2013 and his non-stop tactical creativity would also make him fun to watch.We can only wonder what bets people would have made on that battle back in the day if they had had such an opportunity. One-day win, draw or 'Napoleon to destroy Third Coalition before the new year'?",
